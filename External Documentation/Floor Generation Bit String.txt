Bit String Generation Command

Generation Modifier Ideas:
    Randomize Rooms after each segment repetition
    Join rooms when collide
    Update current room's path spread distance to match older room's path spread distance - 1
    Update older room's path spread distance to match current room's path spread distance - 1   --  Would also prompt that room to try adding neighbor rooms again.
    Escape portal rooms.  -  Can return to surface early, but many monsters in the room.  Also, portal closes if not entered soon enough.
    Intersperse boss rooms.  Low chance for boss to be in non-exit room.
    


32 bits per command segment  (A safe overkill, also, should be easy to work with individual bytes)

   Repetitions of segment   |   Next Direction Bits   |   Wall Chance   |   Controller Bits1   |   Controller Bits2   |
             4              |           4             |        8        |          8           |          8           |
            
Repetitions 1 - 16

Wall Chance 0 - 255


Controller Bits (16) (MSB(15) to LSB(0)) xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

15. Depth or breadth first sprawl
    if (ControllerBits1 == 1xxx xxxx)
    then depth first
    else breadth first
    
14. Shuffle active rooms after a complete pass of possible rooms for this segment
    if (ControllerBits1 == x1xx xxxx)
    then shuffle
    else don't shuffle
    
13. Shuffle possible rooms for this segment
    if (ControllerBits1 == xx1x xxxx)
    then shuffle
    else don't shuffle
    
12. Toggle whether this segment is depth or breadth first after a complete pass
    if (ControllerBits1 == xxx1 xxxx)
    then toggle
    else don't toggle
    
11. Connect adjacent rooms
    if (ControllerBits1 == xxxx 1xxx)
    then connect
    else don't connect

10. Always branch from new room
    if (ControllerBits1 == xxxx x1xx)
    then get and remove the "next" room from the list and put it at the "end"
    else get the "next" room, but do not remove or re-add
